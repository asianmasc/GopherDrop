## üñ•Ô∏è **Endpoints**

### **API Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                              |
|--------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/send`            | Create a new send (text or file)         |
| `GET`  | `/send/:id`        | Retrieve a send by its hash              |
| `GET`  | `/send/:id/check`  | Check if a send requires a password      |

### **Example: Create a Send**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send \
  -F "type=text" \
  -F "data=This is a secret message" \
  -F "password=mysecurepassword"
```

## üåê **UI**

The UI provides a simple way to create and view sends.

### **Create a Send**

1. Go to `http://localhost:8081`
2. Enter your secret (text or file).
3. Set an optional password and expiration.
4. Click **Create** and share the generated link.

### **View a Send**

1. Open the provided link.
2. If password-protected, enter the password.
3. View or copy the secret. Download files directly from the UI.

## üê≥ **Docker Deployment**

To deploy GopherDrop using Docker Compose:

```bash
make build
make up
```

## üîí **Security Best Practices**

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted with AES-256 before storage.
- **Passwords**: Optional password protection for additional security.
- **One-Time Use**: Option to delete sends after a single access.
- **Expiration**: Sends auto-delete after the set expiration time.
